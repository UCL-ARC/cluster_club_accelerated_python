# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! The general contribution process is outlined below.

## Report Bugs

Report bugs using GitHub issues.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

## Implement your changes and feedback

The project could always be improved e.g. through fixes to typographical and grammatical errors. Readers might want to contribute additional numerical examples to better highlight the concepts presented here.

## Submit Feedback

The best way to offer feedback is to file an issue on GitHub.

* Explain in detail how it works, providing links to official documentation of upstream projects.
